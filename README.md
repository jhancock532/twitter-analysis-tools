# twitter-analysis-tools
A selection of tools to gather data from Twitter (for free!). Coded in python, made with love.

<i>You will need to get a Twitter Dev account and get an application set up for your secrets and tokens. Without the variables ckey, csecret, atoken and asecret assigned correctly the code will not work. I have imported the libraries genderGuesser and textBlob to handle some of the data analysis, if you want store gender and perform sentiment analysis you shall have to do the same or hack an alternative. </i>

GetUsernames.py streams tweets live from Twitter and stores the usernames of each tweet to a text file. Decide where you want to conduct your sample from, and plug the geographic coordinates into the GetUsernames.py code (at the very bottom!). You can add other variables to the streamer code, such as text and language used, if you are looking for something more specific. Leave the code to run for as long as nescessary for your sample. To remove any duplicate usernames from the file, go to http://textmechanic.com/text-tools/basic-text-tools/remove-duplicate-lines/.  

GetUserInfo.py systematically works its way through every username in the textfile (as generated by GetUsernames.py) getting data, processing it, and saving it to a mysqlite database. Comment out code that you don't need, but make sure that if you remove variables also remove them from the database definition and the save to database function (found at the beginning and end of the code respectively).
